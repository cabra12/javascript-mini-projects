# To Do List App
This is a simple and interactive to-do list application made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. 

## How It Works
* You can add a task by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. This will increment a counter below
* Tasks can be toggled to be checked and unchecked, with a strike-through mechanism and additional counter enabled depending on what the user wants
* Deleting tasks is done by clicking the "X" button, and updates to both counters will occur

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3: Flexbox layout and responsive stylying through pseudo-elements 
* Javascript(ES6+): event listeners, DOM manipulation, arrow functions, classList toggling

## Future Improvements
* using localStorage to keep tasks when the page refreshes
* add edit functionality for existing tasks 
* scroll mechanism for the list
* add more keyboard mechanisms, such as pressing the "Enter" key to submit or using arrow keys to highlight certain tasks
